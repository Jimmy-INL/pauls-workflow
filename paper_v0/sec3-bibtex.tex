\section{Bibtex and references}

\noindent I use Jabref as a reference manager for citations like this one~\cite{asmbook}. To get the bibtex records for papers, I find the paper on its journal's webpage and click something like 'Download citation' that most of the journals have. That's a good place to start, but the bibtex records are often imperfect.
