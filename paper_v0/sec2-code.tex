\section{Code and examples}
\label{sec:examples}

\noindent I put all the scripts that run the numerical experiments and the data they generate (assuming it's a resonable size) in the \texttt{code} directory. Doing this makes it easier to return to the code that generated a particular figure. I also use \texttt{git} and \url{bitbucket.org} to make the scripts accessible online. See my existing scripts at \url{bitbucket.org/paulcon}.
