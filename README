This repo contains the files I start with when working on a paper.

To compile workflow.tex in paper_v0, cd into paper_v0 and type 'make'.

The typical lifecycle of a paper is:
(1) Write the paper (don't forget to spellcheck).
(2) Write a cover letter.
(3) Put the codes on bitbucket.
(4) Submit the paper.
(5) Put the paper on arXiv.

Once the reviews come back:
(1) Revise the paper according to reviewers' comments.
(2) Write reseponses for the reviewers' comments.
(3) Generate a latexdiff.
(4) Submit the revision with reviewer responses.
(5) Update the arXiv and bitbucket.
